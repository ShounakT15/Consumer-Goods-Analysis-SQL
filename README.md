# Consumer-Goods-Analysis-SQL
## Problem Statement
Atliq Hardwares is one of India's leading computer hardware producers and is well expanded in other countries.

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Their data analytics director wanted to hire someone good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct an SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.

- Check ‘ad-hoc-requests.pdf’ - there are 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights.
- You need to run a SQL query to answer these requests.
- The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management, hence, you need to create a presentation to show the insights.
